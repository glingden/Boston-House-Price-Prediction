# Boston-House-Price-Prediction
MLP feedforward neural network is a simple Artificial Neural Network. It  contains one or more hidden layers (apart from one input and one output layer). In addition to the  linear functions, a multi layer perceptron can also learn nonâ€“linear functions. They are used for both regression and classification problem. The arrows in the diagram below shows the follow of information from one neuron to another in differnt layers. In MLP feedforward, no feedback propagation of information.

In this project, the boston house data was used to build the model. The data set can be found from here, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/.
