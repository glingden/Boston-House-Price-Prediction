MLP feedward neural network is the simplest Artificial Neural Network. A Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP)  contains one or 
more hidden layers (apart from one input and one output layer). While a single layer perceptron can
only learn linear functions, a multi layer perceptron can also learn non â€“ linear functions
