MLP feedward neural network is the simplest Artificial Neural Network. It  contains one or more hidden layers (apart from one input and one output layer). Aparts from the  linear functions, a multi layer perceptron can also learn non â€“ linear functions. They are used for both regression and classification in supervised learning. The diagram below shows the follow of inforamtion from one neuron to another in differnt layers in MLP network architecture.
